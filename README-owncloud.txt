this fork is designed to support ownCloud on a qnap (tested with OC 5.0.10 and qnap 4.0.2) in conjunction with an external email provider.
This may work in other environments too.
due to the design incompatibilities between ActiveSync and CardDAV / Cal DAV you will loose data or data sturcture.

the actual version changed the supported ActiveSync version to 12.0 to support HTML mail natively.

todo:
implement changessink in all backends and backend combined
